Class component assignment
The goal of this assignment is to do the following:

1. Implement a delete button for each task. The delete button should remove that specific task from the state array, thus deleting the task itself! Styling isn't a priority at this moment, but the button tag should be styled by default.

2. Implement a new class component, Count that displays the count of the number of todos, at any given time.

3. Implement an edit button for each task. It should replace the todo with an input field, and change the button itself to 'Resubmit', so the edits can be saved. This is a comparatively harder task, kudos for when you finish it!
